Description: ``svg.charts`` - Package for generating SVG Charts in Python
        ============================================================

        Status and License
        ------------------
        
        ``svg.charts`` is a pure-python library for generating charts and graphs
        in SVG, originally based on the SVG::Graph Ruby package by Sean E. Russel.
        
        ``svg.charts`` supercedes ``svg_charts`` 1.1 and 1.2.
        
        ``svg.charts`` is written by Jason R. Coombs.  It is licensed under an
        `MIT-style permissive license
        <https://py-svg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/py-svg/trunk/docs/license.txt>`_.
        
        You can install it with ``easy_install svg.charts``, or from the
        `subversion repository
        <https://py-svg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/py-svg/trunk#egg=svg.charts-dev>`_ with
        ``easy_install svg.charts==dev``.
        
        Acknowledgements
        ----------------
        
        ``svg.charts`` depends heavily on lxml and cssutils. Thanks to the
        contributors of those projects for stable, performant, standards-based
        packages.
        
        Sean E. Russel for creating the SVG::Graph Ruby package from which this
        Python port was originally derived.
        
        Leo Lapworth for creating the SVG::TT::Graph package which the Ruby
        port was based on.
        
        Stephen Morgan for creating the TT template and SVG.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        ``svg.charts`` has some examples (taken directly from the reference implementation)
        in `tests/testing.py <https://py-svg.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/py-svg/trunk/tests/testing.py>`_.
        These examples show sample usage of the various chart types. They should provide a
        good starting point for learning the usage of the library.
        
        An example of using ``svg.charts`` in a `CherryPy
        <http://www.cherrypy.org/>`_ web app can be found in `jaraco.site.charts
        <https://svn.jaraco.com/jaraco/python/jaraco.site/trunk/jaraco/site/charts.py>`_.
        If the site is working, you can see the `rendered output here
        <http://www.jaraco.com/charts/plot>`_.
        
        Upgrade Notes
        -------------
        
        Upgrading from 1.x to 2.0
        
        I suggest removing SVG 1.0 from the python installation.  This involves removing the SVG directory (or svg_chart*) from site-packages.
        
        Change import statements to import from the new namespace.
        
        from SVG import Bar
        Bar.VerticalBar(...)
        becomes
        from svg.charts.bar import VerticalBar
        VerticalBar(...)
        
        More To-Dos
        -----------
        
        -  Documentation! This package desperately needs some high-level,
           tutorial-style how-tos, and not just links to example code.
        -  Implement javascript-based animation (See JellyGraph for a Silverlight example of what simple animation can do for a charting library).
        
        Reporting Bugs and Getting Help
        -------------------------------
        
        This project is `hosted at sourceforge
        <https://sourceforge.net/projects/py-svg/>`_. Please use that site for
        reporting bugs and requesting help. Patches are also welcome.
        
        Changes
        -------
        
        2.0.5
        ~~~~~
        
        * Altered the way CSS files are loaded, so they can be more easily
          customized by subclasses (and less dependent on the class names).
        
        2.0.4
        ~~~~~
        
        * A small attempt to improve the documentation - added links to examples
          that already exist.
        
        2.0.3
        ~~~~~
        
        * Fix IndexError in ``svg.charts.plot.Plot.field_size`` when there are
          only two values returned by float_range (in the case there are only
          two different 'y' values in the data) and scale_y_integers == True.
          Credit to `Jean Schurger <http://schurger.org/>`_ for the patch.
        * Fixed problem in setup.py installing on Unix OS (case sensitivity of 
          readme.txt). Credit to Luke Miller and Jean Schurger for supplying
          a patch for this issue.
        
        2.0.2
        ~~~~~
        
        * Updated cssutils dependency to 0.9.6 (currently in beta) to require the CSS profiles support.
        * Completed an SVG CSS profile according to the SVG 1.1 spec.
        
        2.0.1
        ~~~~~
        
        * Added preliminary SVG CSS profile, suitable for stock CSS properties.
        
        2.0
        ~~~~~
        
        * First major divergence from the Ruby reference implementation
        * Now implemented as a namespace package (svg.charts instead of svg_charts)
        * Changed XML processor to lxml
        * Enabled extensible css support using cssutils, greatly reducing static CSS
        * Renamed modules and methods to be more consistent with PEP-8 naming convention
        
        1.2
        ~~~
        
        * Bug fixes
